# little-scripts

This is an assortment of simple shell scripts I've written to make my life easier.  I've published them because they might be useful as a starting point for somebody else.

# oe2es and es2oe

These are simple scripts that copy save states and battery files between retroarch ("es" for emulationstation) and OpenEmu ("oe").
