# little-scripts

This is an assortment of simple shell scripts I've written to make my life easier.  I've published them because they might be useful as a starting point for somebody else.

# oe2es and es2oe

These are simple scripts that copy save states and battery files between retroarch ("es" for emulationstation) and OpenEmu ("oe").

# fix-kimai-invoice

This takes the CSV output of an "export" from Kimai on stdin, strips out the stuff I don't want, fixes the date format, and outputs it on stdout.  May be useful as a starting point if you're also using Kimai for invoicing.
